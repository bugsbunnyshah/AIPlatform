Braineous, AI Platform - Getting Started
This guide covers:

* Running the Platform as a Microservice

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 8 or 11+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven {maven-version}

[TIP]
.Verify Maven is using the Java you expect
====
If you have multiple JDK's installed it is not certain Maven will pick up the expected java
and you could end up with unexpected results.
You can verify which JDK Maven uses by running `mvn --version`. 
====


== Architecture

In this guide, we create a straightforward application serving a `hello` endpoint. To demonstrate
dependency injection, this endpoint uses a `greeting` bean.

This guide also covers the testing of the endpoint.

== What's next?

This guide covered the creation of an application using Quarkus.
However, there is much more.
We recommend continuing the journey with the link:building-native-image[building a native executable guide], where you learn about creating a native executable and packaging it in a container.
If you are interested in reactive, we recommend the link:getting-started-reactive[Getting started with reactive guide], where you can see how to implement reactive applications with Quarkus.

In addition, the link:tooling[tooling guide] document explains how to:

* scaffold a project in a single command line
* enable the _development mode_ (hot reload)
* import the project in your favorite IDE
* and more
